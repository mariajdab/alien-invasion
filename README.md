# alien-invasion

### assumptions
- Only if in the same city there are two aliens, then they will fight. If there three or more is an assumption that the could have a good relation, and of course, is needed at least two aliens to have a fight.

- The file containing the names of cities in the non-existent world of X will be at the root of the project, if you need to prove with a new file please update the constant ```worldMap``` with the name of the file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file will be read and the data parsed in order to extract only the valuable information, each line of the file that contains the main city and its adjacent cities will be saved on a map of maps in Go, in an attempt to working easily and efficient. The directions will not be saved.

An example of this, consider that if want to read and parse the file ```cities_list.txt``` found in this repository: 


A possible map of the firts cities (main cities) that appers in each line of the file ```cities_list.txt```, will be the following:
